        <h2>Gordon Ramsay's scrambled eggs</h2>
        <p>
            If there is one thing that grinds Gordon's gears, its overcooked scrambled eggs. This recipe will ensure that your scrambled eggs always come out <em>fluffy</em>
            and <em>light</em>. The main thing to keep in mind is eggs <strong>overcook</strong> very <strong>easily</strong> and even after you shut down the heat, the eggs will continue to cook in the hot pan.
            The key to the fluffy and lightness of the eggs is the <em>constant</em> stirring required in this recipe, so get ready for a workout.
