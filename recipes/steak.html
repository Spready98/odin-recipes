        <h2>A5-grade wagyu steak </h2>
        <p> The most coveted and <em>expensive</em> cut of steak is the Japanese A5 wagyu. The main defining characteristic of a wagyu steak in general is the <em>marbling</em>. 
            Due to the high fat content (marbling) of a wagyu steak, it must be prepared in a <em>unique</em> way compared to a standard grocery store steak. However,
            just cause a wagyu steak needs to be prepared differently, does not mean it is neccessarily harder to prepare. In actuality, it is simpler to cook a wagyu
            and requires less technical skill. The <strong>simplicity</strong> of the recipe allows the wagyu to take centre stage. Generally, keeping things simple with
            <em>high quality</em> ingredients is optimal to get the most out of the ingredient. For example, oil is not required for a A5 Wagyu steak because it already 
            has such high relative fat content that will melt like butter.
